# Predictive-Modeling-for-Customer-Retention-in-Mobile-Food-Delivery

## Project Title: Predictive Modeling for Customer Retention in Mobile Food Delivery

## Objective:
Develop a predictive model to predict customer churn using demographic and transactional data from a mobile food delivery service.

## Dataset:
The dataset includes customer information such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, monthly income, meal preferences, and customer satisfaction indicators.

## Key Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary features and selecting relevant columns.
2. Feature Engineering: Created new features, including average order value and a high-frequency customer flag.
3. Data Transformation: Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables and handled missing data.
4. Modeling: Plan to use machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict churn.
